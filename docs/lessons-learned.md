How to contribute

- Add a new section `## <Short Title>` with: Symptom, Environment (if relevant), Fix pattern, and a minimal code example.
- Keep product names, versions, and file paths specific so we can recognize when a lesson might be stale as dependencies change.
- DO add knowledge hard won during the course of development to avoid waisting time in the future.
- DON'T bloat this file with fixes to obvious mistakes or easily ascertained knowledge.

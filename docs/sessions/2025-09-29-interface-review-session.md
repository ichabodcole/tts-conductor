# 2025-09-29 Interface Review Session

## Goals

- Capture gaps discovered during TTS core ↔ ElevenLabs provider interface review.
- Produce a proposal documenting recommended interface adjustments.
- Implement the proposed changes.

## Summary

Reviewed the TTS interface alignment proposal, expanded it with implementation details, and completed all changes.

## Completed Work

### 1. Proposal Review and Enhancement

- Reviewed `docs/proposals/tts-interface-alignment.md` against actual codebase
- Validated all findings (duplicate duration calculation, missing provider ID, unused metadata)
- Added fourth finding: propagate provider ID via context
- Enhanced proposal with comprehensive Implementation Details section including:
  - Clear decisions on either/or choices
  - Before/after interface comparisons
  - Concrete code changes for all affected files
  - Test updates and new test cases
  - 10-point acceptance criteria
  - Validation commands

### 2. Implementation

All interface changes completed and verified:

- ✅ `TtsProviderContext` now includes `id: string`
- ✅ `TtsProvider` interface includes `readonly id: string`
- ✅ `GenerationResult` fields (`mimeType`, `duration`, `size`) are now optional
- ✅ `conductor.createProvider` passes `id` in context
- ✅ `operations.ts` uses `provider.id` directly (removed unsafe cast)
- ✅ `operations.ts` trusts provider-supplied duration with fallback to ffprobe
- ✅ `ElevenLabsProvider` assigns `this.id = ctx.id` in constructor
- ✅ All test mocks updated to include `id` field
- ✅ Added tests for duration trust/fallback behavior

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated `packages/tts-core/README.md`:
  - Removed references to old typed API methods
  - Updated factory example to show `id: ctx.id` assignment
  - Documented optional `GenerationResult` fields
  - Simplified to single unified API
- Updated `packages/tts-provider-elevenlabs/README.md`:
  - Removed "Backward Compatibility" section
  - Updated all examples to use unified API

### 4. Verification

- All 40 tests passing (31 in core, 9 in elevenlabs)
- Build successful across both packages
- No linter errors

## Outcomes

The interface alignment eliminates:

1. **Duplicate ffprobe invocations** - providers can supply duration, core trusts it
2. **Unsafe type casts** - provider ID flows through context automatically
3. **Unnecessary metadata requirements** - optional fields give providers flexibility

Performance improvement: One ffprobe call per chunk (when provider supplies duration) instead of two.

## Files Modified

### Core Changes

- `packages/tts-core/src/factory.ts` - Added `id` to `TtsProviderContext`

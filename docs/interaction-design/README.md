# Interaction Design Documentation

This directory contains interaction design documentation that captures how users interact with different parts of your application. These documents focus on UX flows, user journeys, and the design thinking behind interaction patterns - helping developers and designers understand how features work from the user's perspective.

## Purpose

Interaction design documents serve as the authoritative reference for understanding **how users experience specific features and flows** in your application. They describe user journeys, decision points, interaction patterns, and the design rationale behind them.

Think of interaction design docs as **maps of user journeys** - they show the path users take through features, where they make decisions, what they see and do at each step, and why the experience is structured the way it is.

**This is NOT a design systems directory.** We're not documenting design tokens, component libraries, or visual language here. This directory is specifically for documenting **how users interact with features and flows** - the interaction layer that sits alongside your technical architecture.

## Primary Use Case: Feature Flows & Interaction Patterns

The purpose of this directory is to document **how specific parts of your application work from the user's perspective**:

- **Creation flows** - How users create or add new things
- **Update/edit flows** - How users modify existing items
- **Settings systems** - How configuration works and how it affects other features
- **Onboarding sequences** - First-time user experiences
- **Complex multi-step processes** - Checkout, wizard flows, multi-stage forms
- **Feature subsystems** - Discrete parts of your app with their own interaction logic

These documents answer: "What does the user experience when they interact with this part of the app, and why is it designed this way?"

## Why Document Interaction Design?

- **Preserve design rationale** - Capture _why_ interaction decisions were made, not just what was built
- **Prevent unintentional changes** - Help developers understand design intent before making modifications
- **Build shared understanding** - Create common vocabulary between designers, developers, and stakeholders
- **Enable confident iteration** - Make updates knowing what users experience and why it matters
- **Facilitate onboarding** - Help new team members understand how features work from the user's perspective
- **Bridge design and code** - Complement technical architecture docs with user-centric perspective
- **Document decision points** - Capture where and why users make choices in flows

## What to Document

Interaction design docs capture:

- **User flows and journeys** - Step-by-step experiences through features
- **Decision points and branching** - Where users make choices and how it affects their path
- **Design rationale** - Why interaction patterns exist, what problems they solve, what alternatives were considered
- **UI component choices** - When it matters _why_ a specific component or pattern was selected
- **Error states and edge cases** - How the experience changes in different situations
- **Interactions between features** - How flows connect to or affect other parts of the app
- **Accessibility patterns** - How users with different needs navigate the experience

**Appropriate level of detail:** Focus on the user journey and design thinking. Document what users see and do at each step, why it's structured that way, and what decisions they make. Don't document exact pixel specs, design tokens, or exhaustive UI details - that lives in design files, component libraries, and code.

**Avoid exhaustive detail:** If your doc feels like a UI specification document, you've gone too deep. Keep it focused on experience and rationale.

## When to Create Interaction Design Documents

Create interaction design documentation for:

- **Complex user flows** - Multi-step processes where users make meaningful decisions
- **Feature subsystems** - Distinct parts of your app with their own interaction logic
- **Settings or configuration** - Especially when settings affect experiences elsewhere
- **Onboarding or setup** - First-time user experiences
- **Core user journeys** - Critical paths through your application
- **Interaction patterns with important rationale** - When knowing _why_ a pattern exists matters

**Don't create interaction design docs for:**

- Simple CRUD operations with standard patterns
- Individual UI components without meaningful flow context
- Standard interactions fully documented in design files
- Every page in your app - focus on flows and subsystems, not exhaustive coverage
- Design tokens, color systems, typography scales - those belong in design system documentation, not here

## File Naming and Organization

- **Feature flows:** `[feature]-flow.md` or `[action]-flow.md`
  - Examples: `creation-flow.md`, `checkout-flow.md`, `settings-flow.md`
- **Complex subsystems with multiple flows:** Create subdirectories with `README.md`
  - Example: `onboarding/README.md` with multiple flow documents inside

## Template

A ready-to-use template is available: **[TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md)**

The template is optimized for documenting **user flows and interaction patterns** within specific features.

### Key Sections

The template includes:

- **Purpose & User Goals** - What users are trying to accomplish
- **User Flow** - Step-by-step journey with rationale for each step
- **Decision Points & Branching** - Where users make choices
- **Key Design Decisions** - Important patterns and why they exist
- **UI Components & Patterns** - Only when component choice matters to the experience
- **States & Edge Cases** - How the experience changes in different situations
- **Interactions Between Systems** - How this flow connects to other parts of the app
- **Design Rationale & Trade-offs** - Why this approach, alternatives considered
- **Accessibility Considerations** - How different users navigate the experience

Adapt the structure to fit your flow - not all sections may be relevant. Skip sections that don't add value.

## Tips

### Writing Interaction Design Docs

- **Focus on the journey, not the pixels** - Document what users experience and why, not exact UI specs
- **Start with user goals** - Explain what users are trying to accomplish and what problems the design solves
- **Document the "why"** - For each major step or pattern, explain why it exists and what alternatives were considered
- **Capture decision points** - Where do users make meaningful choices? How does it affect their experience?
- **Think flows and subsystems, not pages** - Document user journeys through features, not every individual screen
- **Call out design rationale** - Help developers understand _why_ something is designed a certain way so they don't change it on a whim
- **Show connections** - How does this flow relate to other parts of the app?
- **Include visuals sparingly** - Screenshots or flow diagrams when they clarify, but don't over-document
- **Reference implementation** - Link to code and design files, but don't duplicate what's there
- **Document for developers** - These docs help devs understand the full picture before making changes

### Common Patterns to Document

- **Why we chose this UI component over alternatives** - When it matters to the experience
- **Why steps are ordered this way** - Rationale behind flow sequence
- **Why we ask for information at this point** - Design thinking behind data collection
- **Why this pattern solves a specific user problem** - Connect design to user needs
- **How error states guide users to recovery** - Not just what errors look like, but how they help
- **How settings in one place affect experiences elsewhere** - Feature interactions

### Keeping It Useful, Not Exhaustive

- **Avoid over-documentation** - If readers would rather look at Figma or code than finish your doc, it's too detailed
- **Skip obvious sections** - Not every flow needs Responsive Behavior or Micro-interactions sections
- **Write for understanding** - Help someone grasp "what's the user experience and why is it this way"
- **Update as flows evolve** - Keep docs current when design changes significantly
- **Review periodically** - Check "Last Reviewed" dates and verify accuracy

### Interaction Design vs. Architecture Docs

- **Interaction Design docs** - Focus on user experience, design rationale, user flows
  - "What does the user see and do in the creation flow, and why is it designed this way?"
- **Architecture docs** - Focus on technical implementation, code structure, system design
  - "How is the creation feature implemented technically, what are the major components?"

Both are valuable and complement each other. A developer working on a feature should look at:

1. The **interaction design doc** to understand the user experience and design intent
2. The **architecture doc** to understand the technical implementation
3. The **code** to see the actual implementation details

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Proposals** capture ideas for future features; interaction design docs describe existing user experiences
- **Plans** outline implementation roadmaps; interaction design docs explain the resulting user flows
- **Architecture** docs explain technical systems; interaction design docs explain user interaction patterns
- **Playbooks** describe how to execute recurring tasks; interaction design docs explain the interaction patterns involved
- **Sessions** document what happened during work; interaction design docs provide UX context for understanding that work

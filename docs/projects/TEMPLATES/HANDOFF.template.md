<!--
USAGE: Copy this file to your project folder as `handoff.md` when the work
requires specific deployment or integration steps to ship successfully.

Most projects won't need this — only create it when deployment involves more
than merging code (e.g., database migrations, service redeployments, environment
config changes, manual coordination steps).

Create this during branch finalization, when all steps are known.

# Deployment Handoff — [Feature/Change Name]

## Prerequisites

[Systems, services, or states that must exist before deployment. Examples:
environment variables set, feature flags configured, dependent services updated.]

## Deployment Steps

1. [Step with any dependencies or timing notes]
2. [Step with verification criteria if applicable]
3. [Continue as needed]

## Verification

[How to confirm deployment succeeded. What to check, what endpoints to hit, what
logs to review.]

## Rollback

[How to undo if something goes wrong. Which steps are reversible and which
aren't.]

## Notes

[Timing requirements, coordination with other teams, edge cases, or anything
the deployer should know.]

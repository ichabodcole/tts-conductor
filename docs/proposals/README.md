# Feature Proposals

This directory contains feature proposal documents that serve as the primary starting point for any new feature development in this project.

## Purpose

The main purpose of a feature proposal is to provide a comprehensive overview of a new feature before development begins. This includes defining the feature's scope, objectives, and high-level requirements. These documents are intended to be the first resource that a developer or an AI agent consults when tasked with implementing a new feature.

## Content and Format

While the format of a proposal is flexible and should be tailored to its content (e.g., a new feature versus a refactoring plan), the goal is always to provide clarity and establish a shared understanding. A good proposal is not beholden to a rigid structure but should answer key questions to guide development.

### Guiding Questions for a Proposal

Instead of a strict template, consider addressing the following:

- **The "Why":** What problem is being solved? What are the goals and objectives?
- **The "What":** What is the proposed solution at a high level? What are the key components, pages, or user-facing changes?
- **The Scope:** What is explicitly included and excluded? What does an MVP or the first iteration look like?
- **Impact and Dependencies:** How does this interact with existing features? What are the data model considerations or technical prerequisites?
- **Open Questions:** What aspects are still undecided and require further discussion?

By focusing on these areas, we ensure a proposal serves as a solid foundation for breaking down work into specific development tasks. This document acts as a touchstone throughout the development lifecycle of the feature.

# @tts-conductor/core

Foundation for shared text-to-speech orchestration. The implementation is not yet ported from the Hypnotyche app, but this package will eventually expose parsing, chunking, stitching, and configuration primitives.

## Scripts
- `pnpm build` – compile TypeScript to `dist/`
- `pnpm dev` – watch build output
- `pnpm lint` – placeholder for linting setup
- `pnpm test` – placeholder for automated tests
